# COMPSYS 303 Pacemaker

## How to use:
### Modes:
`Switch 0`: Toggles the mode (SCCharts = 0, C Code = 1)

`Switch 1`: Toggles the input mode (Buttons = 0, UART = 1)

### Buttons:
`Key 0`: Simulates a ventricular event

`Key 1`: Simulates an atrial event

### UART:
Sending an `A` or `V` character to the pacemaker simulates an atrial or ventricular event respectively

Recieving an `A` or `V` character from the pacemaker represents an atrium pulse or ventricular pulse respectively

### LEDs:
`Green LED 0`: Represents `VP`

`Green LED 1`: Represents `AP`

`Red LED 0`: Represents `VS`

`Red LED 1`: Represents `AS`
