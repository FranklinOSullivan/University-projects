## Project Brief:
The project you will engage in will require you to work with a custom two-wheeled robot to navigate a maze. The path of the maze is projected as a line from a ceiling mounted projector. The walls of the maze are not projected. The robot comes with electronics to drive the motors and provides an interface to a Cypress PSoC 5 development kit - the Kit 059. The motors include a gearbox and rotation sensors.During the course of this project, you will design and build a sensor PCB to locate and position your robot on the projected line. With this information, you will program the PSoC, in C, to complete one of several objectives.

  ## Objectives: 
**Hardware Design**

  1. Design and configure hardware subsystems for use with a microcontroller
  1. Test subsystems, integrate them by physically installing and wiring them as well as writing
    some code
  1. You will write code for a microcontroller to execute low level APIs that can be used by higher
    level programs.
  1. You will write code for PCâ€™s (Matlab or equivalent) to analyse or understand the performance
    of your subsystems 
    
**Software Design**

  1. Design a software solution to solve path planning requirement.
  1. Select a suitable algorithm to solve the problem(s). Create suitable data structures to suit.
  1. Test your software
