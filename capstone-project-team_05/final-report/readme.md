# Final Report LaTeX Template

This folder contains the templates for your final project report ([see Canvas assignment](https://canvas.auckland.ac.nz/courses/106044/assignments/376416)).

The LaTeX template consists of the following files:
* *template.tex*: this file contains the LaTeX template and should be used for generating your Final Report submission. You can import this file into Overleaf if you want to use it.
* *capstone.cls*: the class file for the template, simplifies the title page.
* *unnumberedtotoc.sty*: the style for the table of contents.
* *_build.cmd*: a build script for compiling the template on a Windows system. This assumes that you have miktex installed.

There are also the following image files:
* *ecse-decal-title.png*: the image for the title page. This image is required in your reports (and does not count towards the page limit.)
* *plunket-large.png*: the Plunket logo, large size.
* *plunket-medium.png*: the Plunket logo, medium size.
* *plunket-small.png*: the Plunket logo, small size.

You may use any of the Plunket logos within your proposal.

## Instructions:

Change the team number on the first page. The number is on line 19 of the initial template.
