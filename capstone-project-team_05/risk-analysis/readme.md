# Risk Analysis LaTeX Template

This folder contains the templates for your risk-analysis report ([see Canvas assignment](https://canvas.auckland.ac.nz/courses/106044/assignments/376409)).

The LaTeX template consists of the following files:
* *template.tex*: this file contains the LaTeX template and should be used for generating your Risk Analysis submission. You can import this file into Overleaf if you want to use it.
* *_build.cmd*: a build script for compiling the template on a Windows system. This assumes that you have miktex installed.

## Instructions:

Modify the \title{} tag to include your team number.

Modify the \author{} tag to include all the members in your team.
